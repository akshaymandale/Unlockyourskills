# Course-Specific Assessment Validation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fixes the issue where assessments passed in other courses were incorrectly being recognized as completed for post-requisites, prerequisites, and module content. The system now properly validates that assessments must be completed within the same course context.

## Problem Description

Previously, the cross-course assessment detection was too permissive and would recognize assessments passed in ANY course as completed for the current course. This caused issues where:

- **Post-requisite assessments** showed as "Completed" even when not attempted in the current course
- **Prerequisite assessments** were considered satisfied from other courses
- **Module content assessments** were marked as completed from cross-course attempts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Course-Specific Validation Logic

The system now implements strict course-specific validation for:

- **Post-requisites**: Must be completed in the same course
- **Prerequisites**: Must be completed in the same course  
- **Module Content**: Must be completed in the same course

### 2. Changes Made

#### In `controllers/MyCoursesController.php`:

**Module Assessments (Lines ~130-140):**
```php
// For module content, assessment must be completed in THIS course only
$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] = $assessmentModel->getUserAssessmentResults($assessmentId, $userId, $clientId, $course['id']);

// Log course-specific assessment requirement
if (!$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] || !isset($assessmentResults[$assessmentId]['passed'])) {
    error_log("Module assessment {$assessmentId} requires completion in course {$course['id']} for user {$userId}");
}
```

**Prerequisites (Lines ~160-170):**
```php
// For prerequisites, assessment must be completed in THIS course only
$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] = $assessmentModel->getUserAssessmentResults($assessmentId, $userId, $clientId, $course['id']);

// Log course-specific assessment requirement
if (!$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] || !isset($assessmentResults[$assessmentId]['passed'])) {
    error_log("Prerequisite assessment {$assessmentId} requires completion in course {$course['id']} for user {$userId}");
}
```

**Post-requisites (Lines ~190-200):**
```php
// For post-requisites, assessment must be completed in THIS course only
$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] = $assessmentModel->getUserAssessmentResults($assessmentId, $userId, $clientId, $course['id']);

// Log course-specific assessment requirement
if (!$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] || !isset($assessmentResults[$assessmentId]['passed'])) {
    error_log("Post-requisite assessment {$assessmentId} requires completion in course {$course['id']} for user {$userId}");
}
```

### 3. How It Works

1. **Course-Specific Check Only**: The system now only checks for assessment results within the current course
2. **No Cross-Course Fallback**: Removed the logic that would fall back to results from other courses
3. **Strict Validation**: Assessments must be completed in the exact same course context
4. **Course-Specific Attempt Counting**: Attempts are only counted from the same course, not from all courses
5. **Logging**: Added logging to track when assessments require completion in specific courses

### 4. Database Query Logic

The system uses the existing `getUserAssessmentResults()` method with the specific course ID:

```php
$assessmentResults[$assessmentId] = $assessmentModel->getUserAssessmentResults($assessmentId, $userId, $clientId, $course['id']);
```

This ensures that only results from the current course are considered for validation.

### 5. Course-Specific Attempt Counting

A new method `getUserCompletedAssessmentAttemptsForCourse()` was added to the `AssessmentPlayerModel`:

```php
public function getUserCompletedAssessmentAttemptsForCourse($assessmentId, $userId, $courseId, $clientId = null)
{
    // Only counts attempts from the specified course
    // Filters by aa.course_id = :course_id
}
```

This ensures that attempt limits are enforced per course, not globally across all courses.

### 6. Assessment Start Flow Fix

The assessment start flow was updated to use course-specific validation:

- **`canUserTakeAssessment()`**: Now accepts `courseId` parameter for course-specific validation
- **`hasExceededMaxAttempts()`**: Now accepts `courseId` parameter for course-specific attempt counting
- **`createOrGetAttempt()`**: Uses course-specific attempt validation and creates attempts with correct `course_id`

This ensures that when starting an assessment from a post-requisite, the system:
1. Only counts attempts from the current course
2. Creates attempts with the correct course association
3. Loads the assessment player instead of redirecting to my-courses

### 7. Controller Integration Fix

The `MyCoursesController` was updated to use the new course-specific methods:

- **Module Assessments**: Now uses `getUserCompletedAssessmentAttemptsForCourse()` with course ID
- **Prerequisites**: Now uses `getUserCompletedAssessmentAttemptsForCourse()` with course ID  
- **Post-requisites**: Now uses `getUserCompletedAssessmentAttemptsForCourse()` with course ID

This ensures that the course details page correctly displays assessment status based on course-specific attempt counting, not global attempt counting.

## Testing

### Test Scripts

Two test scripts have been created to verify the implementation:

#### 1. Course-Specific Assessment Validation
**File**: `test_course_specific_assessments.php`  
**Usage**: `test_course_specific_assessments.php?course_id=8`

**What It Tests**:
- Course-specific assessment results
- Cross-course assessment results (for comparison)
- Final validation logic
- Post-requisite configuration
- Expected UI behavior

#### 2. Course-Specific Attempt Counting
**File**: `test_course_specific_attempts.php`  
**Usage**: `test_course_specific_attempts.php?course_id=8`

**What It Tests**:
- All attempts across all courses (old method)
- Course-specific attempts only (new method)
- Direct database verification
- Final validation result
- Attempt limit enforcement

#### 3. Assessment Start Flow
**File**: `test_assessment_start_flow.php`  
**Usage**: `test_assessment_start_flow.php?course_id=8`

**What It Tests**:
- Course-specific assessment validation
- Attempt limit checking (course-specific vs global)
- Assessment attempt creation with correct course_id
- Complete start flow simulation
- Assessment player readiness

#### 4. Fix Verification
**File**: `test_fix_verification.php`  
**Usage**: `test_fix_verification.php?course_id=8`

**What It Tests**:
- Comparison between old and new attempt counting methods
- Verification that course-specific counting is working
- Direct database verification
- Fix status confirmation

### Expected Behavior

1. **Course-Specific Results**: Only assessments passed in the same course count
2. **Cross-Course Results**: Results from other courses are ignored for validation
3. **Post-requisites**: Must be completed in the same course
4. **Prerequisites**: Must be completed in the same course
5. **Module Content**: Must be completed in the same course

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Progress Tracking**: Assessments are only marked as completed in the correct course context
2. **Proper Learning Flow**: Users must complete assessments within each course as intended
3. **Data Integrity**: Assessment completion data accurately reflects course-specific progress
4. **User Experience**: Clear indication of what needs to be completed in each course

## Impact on Existing Functionality

### ✅ **What Still Works**
- Assessment attempts tracking
- Assessment details and configuration
- Progress calculation
- All other course functionality

### ✅ **What's Fixed**
- Post-requisite assessment validation
- Prerequisite assessment validation
- Module content assessment validation
- Course-specific progress accuracy

### ✅ **No Breaking Changes**
- Existing assessment data remains intact
- User progress is preserved
- Course structure is unchanged
- Only validation logic is updated

## Example Scenario

**Before Fix:**
- User completes "client 2" assessment in Course 1
- User opens Course 8 (different course)
- Post-requisite "client 2" shows as "Completed" ❌ (incorrect)

**After Fix:**
- User completes "client 2" assessment in Course 1
- User opens Course 8 (different course)
- Post-requisite "client 2" shows as "Start" ✅ (correct)
- User must complete the assessment specifically for Course 8

## Logging and Debugging

The system now includes specific logging for course-specific assessment requirements:

- `Module assessment X requires completion in course Y for user Z`
- `Prerequisite assessment X requires completion in course Y for user Z`
- `Post-requisite assessment X requires completion in course Y for user Z`

## Files Modified

1. **`controllers/MyCoursesController.php`** - Main implementation, assessment start flow, and controller integration
2. **`models/AssessmentPlayerModel.php`** - Added course-specific attempt counting and validation methods
3. **`test_course_specific_assessments.php`** - Test script for assessment validation (new)
4. **`test_course_specific_attempts.php`** - Test script for attempt counting (new)
5. **`test_assessment_start_flow.php`** - Test script for assessment start flow (new)
6. **`test_fix_verification.php`** - Test script for fix verification (new)
7. **`test_fixed_method.php`** - Test script for the final fix (new)
8. **`COURSE_SPECIFIC_ASSESSMENT_README.md`** - This documentation (new)

## Conclusion

The course-specific assessment validation system now ensures that assessments are only considered completed when they are passed within the same course context. This provides accurate progress tracking and maintains the integrity of the learning management system while preserving all existing functionality.

Users will now see the correct status for assessments in each course, and the system will properly enforce course-specific completion requirements.
